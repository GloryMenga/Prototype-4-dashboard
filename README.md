# Dashboard Application

This project is a **Dashboard Application** designed to display student performance data interactively. It includes features such as visualizing grades, tracking trends over time, and managing data dynamically.

## Features

- **Role-Based Display**: Adjustments for students and admin users based on their roles.
- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Fetch data from APIs and render it in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **Chart Library**: Chart.js (with `chartjs-adapter-date-fns` for time formatting)
- **Styling**: CSS for custom styles and layouts.
- **Backend**: Mock API endpoints for fetching data (`http://localhost:5000`).
